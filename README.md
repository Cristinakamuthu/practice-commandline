# practice-commandline

in this applikcation we have movies, actors and directors

i have applied the relationship of one to many where 
* one actor can act in many movies*
* one director can direct many movies *

sooo... in this 
in this application i am able to *CREATE* *DELETE* *UPDATE* AND *READ* data
 i have used albemic migration 

 my application has a unique feature where the foreign key's are both names of either the directors or the actor (i won't lie i do get confused when we use id's instead) though i know there will be challenge when it comes to the time when people will have matching names but eh.. we shall figure that one out later !!!

 next time i'll use flask sooo now lemme go learn ... byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
